The file run_analysis.R reduces the UCI acceleration data from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones  per the instruction in JTLeek's Coursera course on getting and tidying data

It requires that you download the zip file data from this source:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Then unzip the folder and edit the environment declarations at the beginning of the run_analysis.R to ensure it is
reading the the data from the correct locations and writing it to the specified output location.
